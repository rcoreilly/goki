// from "golang.org/x/image/vector"
// devSquared returns a measure of how curvy the sequence (ax, ay) to (bx, by)
// to (cx, cy) is. It determines how many line segments will approximate a
// Bezier curve segment.
//
// http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2016-08/msg00080.html
// gives the rationale for this evenly spaced heuristic instead of a recursive
// de Casteljau approach:
//
// The reason for the subdivision by n is that I expect the "flatness"
// computation to be semi-expensive (it's done once rather than on each
// potential subdivision) and also because you'll often get fewer subdivisions.
// Taking a circular arc as a simplifying assumption (ie a spherical cow),
// where I get n, a recursive approach would get 2^[lg n], which, if I haven't
// made any horrible mistakes, is expected to be 33% more in the limit.
