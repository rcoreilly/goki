// Package lifecycle defines an event for an app's lifecycle, for the GoGI GUI
// system.
//
// The app lifecycle consists of moving back and forth between an ordered
// sequence of stages. For example, being at a stage greater than or equal to
// StageVisible means that the app is visible on the screen.
//
// A lifecycle event is a change from one stage to another, which crosses every
// intermediate stage. For example, changing from StageAlive to StageFocused
// implicitly crosses StageVisible.
//
// Crosses can be in a positive or negative direction. A positive crossing of
// StageFocused means that the app has gained the focus. A negative crossing
// means it has lost the focus.

// crosses. A positive lifecycle change is one where its From stage is less
// than its To stage. Similarly, a negative lifecycle change is one where From
// is greater than To. Thus, a positive lifecycle change crosses every stage in
// the range (From, To] in increasing order, and a negative lifecycle change
// crosses every stage in the range (To, From] in decreasing order.
